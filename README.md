Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA and Random Forests
Project Overview
This project focuses on time series forecasting using two different approaches: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and Random Forest regression models. Time series forecasting is a crucial technique for predicting future values in a sequence of data points. In this project, we specifically focus on forecasting 'Pulse(bpm)' values over time.

Project Components
1. Data Collection
The project begins with data collection. We have gathered time series data that includes 'Pulse(bpm)' measurements along with various other features like 'Meal_Time', 'Date', and more. The data is collected in a structured dataset for analysis.

2. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is an essential step in any data science project. We handle missing values, convert data types, and prepare the dataset for model training. For time series forecasting, we ensure that the data is sorted by the datetime index.

3. Feature Engineering
In this project, we engage in feature engineering by encoding categorical variables like 'Meal_Time' to make them suitable for machine learning models.

4. Data Visualization
Time series data is often best understood through visualization. We create various plots to understand the data's distribution, trends, and seasonality. These visualizations guide our model selection and parameter tuning.

5. ARIMA Modeling
We implement an ARIMA model, which is a classic method for time series forecasting. The ARIMA model is fitted to the historical 'Pulse(bpm)' data, and forecasts are generated. The model's performance is assessed using evaluation metrics.

6. Random Forest Modeling
The core of this project is the Random Forest regression model. We train the model on the historical 'Pulse(bpm)' data to learn patterns and relationships within the time series. Model hyperparameters may be tuned to optimize performance.

7. Model Evaluation
We evaluate the ARIMA and Random Forest models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). These metrics help us assess the accuracy of the forecasts and make necessary adjustments.

8. Visualization
We create plots that illustrate the actual 'Pulse(bpm)' values and compare them with the predicted values from both the ARIMA and Random Forest models. These plots provide insights into the performance of each model.

The project aims to predict 'Pulse(bpm)' values, and the results can be evaluated through metrics and visualizations. By comparing ARIMA and Random Forest models, you can determine the effectiveness of each approach.

Conclusion
Time series forecasting is a valuable tool for making predictions based on historical data. This project demonstrates how to implement time series forecasting using both ARIMA and Random Forest models. The quality of forecasts may vary based on data quality, model selection, and parameter tuning, so experimentation and optimization are encouraged.
